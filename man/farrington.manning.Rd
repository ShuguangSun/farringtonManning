\title{Farrington-Manning test for rate difference}
\usage{
farrington.manning(group1, group2, delta, alternative, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{a logical vector of data from group 1, where \code{TRUE} indicates a success}

\item{group2}{a logical vector of data from group 2, where \code{TRUE} indicates a success}

\item{delta}{the rate difference under the null hypothesis}

\item{alternative}{character string indicating the alternative to use, either of
"two.sided", "less", "greater"}

\item{alpha}{the significance level (acceptable error of the first kind),
 a two-sided confidence intnerval is returned with confidence level 1 - 2*alpha, such that
 the lower bound is a valid one sided confidence interval at the confidence level 1 - alpha.}
}

\description{
The Farrington-Manning test for rate differences can be used to
 compare the rate difference of successes between two groups to a preset value.
 It uses an explicite formula for the standard deviation of the test statistic under
 the null hypothesis [1].

\details{
The Farrington-Maning test for rate differences test the null hypothesis
 of \deqn{H_{0}: p_{1} - p_{2} = \delta}{H[0]: p[1] - p[2] = \delta} for the "two.sided" alternative
 (or \eqn{\qeq}{\ge} for the "greater" respectively \eqn{\leq}{\le} for the "less" alternative).
 This formulation allows to specify non-inferiority and superiority
 test in a consistent manner:
 \describe{
     \item{non-inferiority}{for delta < 0 and alternative == "greater" the null hypothesis
     reads \eqn{H_{0}: p_{1} - p_{2} \geq \delta}{H[0]: p[1] - p[2] \ge \delta} and
     consequently rejection allows concluding that \eqn{p_1 \geq p_2 + \delta}{p[1] \ge p[2] + \delta}
     i.e. that the rate of success in group one is at least the
     success rate in group two plus delta - as delta is negagtive this is equivalent to the success rate of group 1
     being at worst |delta| smaller than that of group 2.}
     \item{superiority}{for delta >= 0 and alternative == "greater" the null hypothesis
     reads \eqn{H_{0}: p_{1} - p_{2} \geq \delta}{H[0]: p[1] - p[2] \ge \delta} and
     consequently rejection allows concluding that \eqn{p_1 \geq p_2 + \delta}{p[1] \ge p[2] + \delta}
     i.e. that the rate of success in group one is at least delta greater than the
     success rate in group two.}
